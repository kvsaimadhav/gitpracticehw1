#Challenges Occurred while learning Rebasing with Master branch from a new branch Slave:

I do not know the correct command initially and read the documentation of the GIT rebase fully. 

Later, I used the command git rebase --onto <newbranch> <oldbranch>. I got the command from GIT rebase atlassian Community. 

Then, I was able to successfully finish the homework1 task of May 24 Web Boot Camp conducted by Sachin Rajgire at Wynisco.
